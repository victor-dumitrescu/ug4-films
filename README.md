### Abstract
This project sets out to explore a representation of film in terms of its characters and their interactions, bringing together different kinds of textual information, such as screenplays and plot summaries. The work described in this report builds upon the existing literature in computational linguistics concerned with studying characters in films and other works of fiction. The character graph model presented here captures two main aspects of film characters: their personalities and their role in the social network of the narrative. We discuss the process of building and evaluating character graphs and show that they accurately predict the sentiment that film characters express towards each other through dialogue.
