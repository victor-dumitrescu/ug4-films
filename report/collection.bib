abstract = {In addition to information, text con- tains attitudinal, and more specifically, emotional content. This paper explores the text-based emotion prediction prob- lem empirically, using supervised machine learning with the SNoW learning archi- tecture. The goal is to classify the emo- tional affinity of sentences in the narra- tive domain of children’s fairy tales, for subsequent usage in appropriate expres- sive rendering of text-to-speech synthe- sis. Initial experiments on a preliminary data set of 22 fairy tales show encourag- ing results over a na¨ ıve baseline and BOW approach for classification of emotional versus non-emotional contents, with some dependency on parameter tuning. We also discuss results for a tripartite model which covers emotional valence, as well as feature set alternations. In addition, we present plans for a more cognitively sound sequential model, taking into considera- tion a larger set of basic emotions.},

abstract = {We present two latent variable models for learning character types, or personas, in film, in which a persona is defined as a set of mixtures over latent lexical classes. These lexical classes capture the stereotypical actions of which a character is the agent and patient, as well as attributes by which they are described. As the first attempt to solve this problem explicitly, we also present a new dataset for the text-driven analysis of film, along with a benchmark testbed to help drive future work in this area.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of automatically inferring latent character types in a collection of 15,099 English novels published between 1700 and 1899. Unlike prior work in which character types are assumed responsible for probabilistically generating all text associated with a character, we introduce a model that employs multiple effects to account for the influence of extra-linguistic information (such as author). In an empirical evaluation, we find that this method leads to improved agreement with the preregistered judgments of a literary scholar, complementing the results of alternative models.},

abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {We present a method for extracting so- cial networks from literature, namely, nineteenth-century British novels and se- rials. We derive the networks from di- alogue interactions, and thus our method depends on the ability to determine when two characters are in conversation. Our approach involves character name chunk- ing, quoted speech attribution and conver- sation detection given the set of quotes. We extract features from the social net- works and examine their correlation with one another, as well as with metadata such as the novel’s setting. Our results provide evidence that the majority of novels in this time period do not fit two characterizations provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our results suggest an alternative explanation for differences in social networks.},

Social relations are intrinsically characterized by the Cartesian product of weights on various axes (we employ valuation and intensity as examples). The prediction of these characteristics is performed by application of unsupervised learning algorithms on meta-data, communication statistics, and the results of deep linguistic analysis of the message body. Classification of sentiment polarity is chosen as the means of linguistic analysis. We find that prediction accuracy can be improved by introducing limited amounts of additional information. **poster papers**},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new Web mining approach that combines social network analysis and automatic sentiment analysis. We show how weighting the forum posts of the contributors according to their network position allow us to predict trends and real world events in the movie business. To test our approach we conducted two experiments analyzing online forum discussions on the Internet movie database (IMDb) by examining the correlation of the social network structure with external metrics such as box office revenue and Oscar Awards. We find that discussion patterns on IMDb predict Academy Awards nominations and box office success. Two months before the Oscars were given we were able to correctly predict nine Oscar nominations. We also found that forum contributions correlated with box office success of 20 top grossing movies of 2006.},

We utilize counts of linguistic reflexes that have been used previously for personality or author recognition to discriminate different charac- ter types.With classification experiments, we show that different types of characters can be distinguished at ac- curacies up to 83\% over a baseline of 20\%.We discuss the characteristics of the learned models and show how they can be used to mimic particular film characters.},

We study a number of specific datasets and show, among other things, how collections of texts can be organized for affect-based search and how books portray different entities through co-occurring emotion words. Analysis of the Enron Email Corpus reveals that there are marked differences across genders in how they use emotion words in work-place email. Finally, we show that fairy tales have more extreme emotion densities than novels. Crown Copyright ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
